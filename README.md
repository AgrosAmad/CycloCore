# CycloCore

CycloCore is an open source implementation of turbulent heat and water continuity in the atmosphere. These commands can be integrated into an existing (one-moment) fluid solver.


It is a core implementation of the paper Cyclogenesis: Simulating Hurricanes and Tornadoes (refer to our [project page](http://computationalsciences.org/publications/amador-herrera-2024-cyclogenesis.html) for more details). This code base contains the following parts:

-- Setup of atmospheric parameters
-- Parametrization of background dry atmosphere
-- Buoyancy and temperature of vapor and cloud matter in the atmosphere
-- Turbulent interaction of dust and wind fields
-- Prognosis equations for tropical cyclones (in cylindrical coordinates)
